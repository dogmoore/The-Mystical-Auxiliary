# The-Mystical-Auxiliary
Just a short text based RPG since I was bored.

This is so far from done tho, as are most of my projects

Even tho I know I won't keep it updated heres a list of what I'm planning:
- [x] magic
- [x] classes with subclasses
- [ ] combat
- [ ] a lived in world
- [ ] allies
- [ ] dynamic enemies
- [ ] a GUI so its not running in console

I do genuinely enjoy writing so I hope the world I create feels large and lively!
