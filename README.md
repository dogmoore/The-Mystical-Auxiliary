# The Mystical Auxiliary
Just a short text based RPG since I was bored.

This is so far from done tho, as are most of my projects.

Even tho I know I won't keep it updated, here is a list of what I'm planning:
- [x] magic
- [x] classes with subclasses
- [ ] combat
- [ ] a lived in world
- [ ] allies
- [ ] dynamic enemies
- [x] a GUI so it's not running in console
- [ ] sound effects

I do genuinely enjoy writing, so I hope the world I create feels large and lively!

I am vaguely planning on an itch.io release along with a download package here.
